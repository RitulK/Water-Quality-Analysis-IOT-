This project is designed to analyze water quality using IoT technology. We employ two sensors: TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) and Turbidity, to measure the water quality parameters. The data collected by these sensors is sent to a MySQL database managed with phpMyAdmin. On the frontend, users can view live readings from the sensors as well as historical data and samples.

Features
Real-time Monitoring: Get live readings from TDS and Turbidity sensors.
Historical Data: Access all the samples and data values stored in the database.
Data Management: Manage data using a MySQL database connected via phpMyAdmin.

Technologies Used
IoT Sensors:
TDS Sensor: Measures the total dissolved solids in water.
Turbidity Sensor: Measures the clarity or cloudiness of water.
Database:
MySQL: For storing sensor data.
phpMyAdmin: For managing the MySQL database.
Frontend:
Web interface to display live sensor readings and historical data.

Usage
Real-time Monitoring:

Navigate to the live readings section on the web interface.
View current TDS and Turbidity values.
Historical Data:

Navigate to the samples section.
Browse through historical data and analyze trends.
